# vim-imtoggle

Toggle Fcitx5 status when entering/leaving insert mode

## Install

With your favorite Vim plugin manager(vim-plug as the example):

```
Plug '5long/vim-imtoggle'
```

## Usage

This plugin comes with 2 commands: `:IMEnable` and `:IMDisable`.
I guess the names are clear enough already.

## Unlicense

See file UNLICENSE.
